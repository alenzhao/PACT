### TREE MANIPULATION
push_times_back 2007				# push dates so that the most recent sample date is 2007
push_times_back 2002 2007			# push dates so that the oldest sample date is 2002 and the most recent sample date is 2007 
prune_to_trunk						# reduces tree to just the trunk
prune_to_label 1					# reduces tree to just the tips with label 1
trim_ends 2003 2004					# reduces tree to only those branches dated between 2003 and 2004
section 2002 0.25 1					# reduces tree into sections, starting at 2002, leaving windows 0.25 in width 
									# and moving in steps of 1
time_slice 2005						# reduces tree to all ancestors of lineages that exist in 2005
									# used in conjunction with diversity statistics

### TREE OUTPUT						# trees are printed in Mathematica compatible rule list format
									# prints to out.rules
print_hp_tree						# print highest posterior / maximum likelihood tree


### SUMMARY STATISTICS				# these statistics are carried out across the entire tree
									# prints to out.stats
summary tmrca						# summarize TMRCA
summary length						# summarize tree length
summary proportions					# summarize label proportions
summary coal_rates					# summarize coalescent rates, separate rates for each label
summary mig_rates					# summarize migration rates, separate rates for each label pair
summary diversity					# summarize diversity between each pair of tips
									# if tree is tip dated should run time_slice first
summary fst							# summarize diversity between labels vs diversity within labels
summary tajima_d					# summarize Tajima's D.  This is pairwise diversity - total tree length / a1.

### SKYLINE STATISTICS				# need to walk these backward to keep window consistent across samples
									# prints to out.skylines
skyline settings 2002 2007 0.1		# split the tree starting at 2002 and ending at 2007 in steps of 0.1
skyling settings 0.1				# split the entire tree in steps of 0.1

skyline tmrca						# computes the TMRCA for time slices
skyline proportions				 	# computes label proportions for time windows
skyline coal_rates					# computes coalescent rates for time windows
skyline mig_rates					# computes migration rates for time windows
skyline diversity					# computes the diversity for time slices 
skyline fst							# computes the FST for time slices
skyline tajima_d					# computes Tajima's D for time slices
