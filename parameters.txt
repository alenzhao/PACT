### PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS
# pick and choose from these commands
# include in file "in.param"
# everything after # is ignored
# commands need to be on separate lines

### TREE MANIPULATION
push times back 2007				# push dates so that the most recent sample date is 2007
push times back 2002 2007			# push dates so that the oldest sample date is 2002 and the most recent sample date is 2007 
prune to trunk						# reduces tree to just the trunk
prune to label 1					# reduces tree to just the tips with label 1
trim ends 2003 2004					# reduces tree to only those branches dated between 2003 and 2004
section tree 2002 0.25 1			# reduces tree into sections, starting at 2002, leaving windows 0.25 in width 
									# and moving in steps of 1
time slice 2005						# reduces tree to all ancestors of lineages that exist in 2005
									# used in conjunction with diversity statistics

### TREE OUTPUT						# trees are printed in Mathematica compatible rule list format
									# prints to out.rules
print hp tree						# print highest posterior / maximum likelihood tree


### SUMMARY STATISTICS				# these statistics are carried out across the entire tree
									# prints to out.stats
summary tmrca						# summarize TMRCA
summary length						# summarize tree length
summary proportions					# summarize label proportions
summary coal rates					# summarize coalescent rates, separate rates for each label
summary mig rates					# summarize migration rates, separate rates for each label pair
summary diversity					# summarize diversity between each pair of tips
									# if tree is tip dated should run time_slice first
summary fst							# summarize diversity between labels vs diversity within labels
summary tajima d					# summarize Tajima's D.  This is pairwise diversity - total tree length / a1.

### SKYLINE STATISTICS				# need to walk these backward to keep window consistent across samples
									# prints to out.skylines
skyline settings 2002 2007 0.1		# split the tree starting at 2002 and ending at 2007 in steps of 0.1
skyline settings 0.1				# split the entire tree in steps of 0.1

skyline tmrca						# computes the TMRCA for time slices
skyline proportions				 	# computes label proportions for time windows
skyline coal rates					# computes coalescent rates for time windows
skyline mig rates					# computes migration rates for time windows
skyline diversity					# computes the diversity for time slices 
skyline fst							# computes the FST for time slices
skyline tajima d					# computes Tajima's D for time slices
